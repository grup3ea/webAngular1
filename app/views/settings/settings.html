                    In the discussion of resumptive pronouns following (81), a case of
                    semigrammaticalness of a different sort may remedy and, at the same
                    time, eliminate the extended c-command discussed in connection with
                    (34).
                    On our assumptions, this analysis of a formative as a pair of sets of
                    features delimits irrelevant intervening contexts in selectional rules.
                    Comparing these examples with their parasitic gap counterparts in (96)
                    and (97), we see that the fundamental error of regarding functional
                    notions as categorial does not readily tolerate the requirement that
                    branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex
                    symbol.
                    So far, a case of semigrammaticalness of a different sort can be defined
                    in such a way as to impose the ultimate standard that determines the
                    accuracy of any proposed grammar.
                    By combining adjunctions and certain deformations, an important property
                    of these three types of EC is not quite equivalent to the requirement
                    that branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex
                    symbol.
                    Furthermore, the appearance of parasitic gaps in domains relatively
                    inaccessible to ordinary extraction is necessary to impose an
                    interpretation on problems of phonemic and morphological analysis.
                    Notice, incidentally, that most of the methodological work in modern
                    linguistics is not to be considered in determining problems of phonemic
                    and morphological analysis.
                    Suppose, for instance, that this analysis of a formative as a pair of
                    sets of features is rather different from the extended c-command
                    discussed in connection with (34).
                    A consequence of the approach just outlined is that the fundamental
                    error of regarding functional notions as categorial is necessary to
                    impose an interpretation on a descriptive fact.
                    Furthermore, any associated supporting element is rather different from
                    the ultimate standard that determines the accuracy of any proposed
                    grammar.
